## 🌟 Tips for Effective Code Reviews

1. **🔄 Review Incrementally**: Regular, small reviews are more effective than infrequent, large reviews.
2. **🗣️ Communicate Clearly**: Provide clear, concise, and constructive feedback.
3. **⚖️ Stay Objective**: Focus on the code, not the coder. Keep reviews professional.
4. **🧩 Be Consistent**: Apply the same standards and practices to every review.
5. **📚 Encourage Learning**: Use reviews as an opportunity to share knowledge and best practices.
6. **⚖️ Balance**: Acknowledge good practices while pointing out areas for improvement.
